# Mobile Price Range Prediction 
***

This project aims to predict the price range of mobile phones using various machine learning models. The models evaluated include Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost with Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).


## Datase-

The target variable is the price range, which is classified into four categories. The other features are mentioned below

**id:** ID

**battery_power:** Total energy a battery can store in one time measured in mAh

**blue:** Has bluetooth or not

**clock_speed:** speed at which microprocessor executes instructions

**dual_sim:** Has dual sim support or not

**fc:** Front Camera mega pixels

**four_g:** Has 4G or not

**int_memory:** Internal Memory in Gigabytes

**m_dep:** Mobile Depth in cm

**mobile_wt:** Weight of mobile phone

**n_cores:** Number of cores of processor

**pc:** Primary Camera mega pixels

**px_height:** Pixel Resolution Height

**px_width:** Pixel Resolution Width

**ram:** Random Access Memory in Megabytes

**sc_h:** Screen Height of mobile in cm

**sc_w:** Screen Width of mobile in cm

**talk_time:** longest time that a single battery charge will last when you are

**three_g** Has 3G or not

**touch_screen:** Has touch screen or not

**wifi:** Has wifi or not


## Use Cases -

This kind of prediction will help companies estimate the prices of mobiles, enabling them to stay competitive against other mobile manufacturers. Additionally, it will be useful for consumers to verify that they are paying the best possible price for a mobile.
